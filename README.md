## Introduction

Shallow Orange is a chess engine developed for a 3-hour challenge, designed to play chess at a basic level. This project was created for fun, to use some of the lessons from classes and combining it with something I enjoy. Shallow Orange is a parody of Deep Blue but named shallow as the engine is weak

## Features

- Basic chess engine functionality
- Developed within a 3-hour time constraint
- Implements simple evaluation, minimaxing, alpha beta pruning and Zobrist Hashing
- Implements book moves

## Limitations

- Long analysis times
- Misses tactics frequently
- Not optimized for strong chess play
- Only reasonable depth for the analysis is 5

## Future Improvements

Shallow Orange may be improved in the future by addressing its limitations, including:
If I ever come back to this project the following things may be used as a jumping point for improvement

- Optimizing algorithms for faster analysis
- Code Cleanup (just to have more coherance)
- Implementing more advanced tactics recognition and searching for useful moves to save minimaxing time and allow for more pruning such as captures, threats and other more complex tactics
- Coding in a different language to improve speed
